<p>I think the best way to start my blog is with the New Year's resolution post. I also wanted to share this list as a way to keep you in the loop on what I will be working on, the things I'm happy about achieving, and the different paths my life may take.</p>

<p>Well, let's get started!<br>2017 has started out amazing for me, because I started with a big goal that I always wanted to achieve. I didn't get into it before because I didn't feel confident in my English skills, but now I'm starting my own Blog and this is the first post <strong>(•_•) ( •_•)>⌐■-■ (⌐■_■)</strong>.<br>Last year was amazing and I accomplished a lot. I finished with a big list of things that I was putting off for many years, but I decided that this year was time to put my hands in all of it, but...</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">**Let's Calm Down**</p>

<h4 style="color:black;font-weight:bold;">When you achieve something, it always makes you want to achieve more.</h4>

<p>So, here is the list with my goals for this year. I will add a strikethrough on the items I'm completing and keep this list updated throughout the year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Expand my knowledge in Swift or in other words, learn how to get the most out of the language.</li>
  <li>Expand my knowledge in iOS Architecture Patterns (MVC, MVP, MVVM, VIPER)</li>
  <li>Learn how to write good Unit Tests in iOS</li>
  <li>Discover different tools to implement CI(Continuous Integration)  and implement it in projects in the company I work for or for my personal projects.</li>
  <li><strike>Have my own blog.</strike></li>
  <li>Write a blog post regularly.</li>
  <li>Prepare talks to bring up internally at work, in meetups and conferences.</li>
  <li>Improve my English.</li>
  <li>Find more partners to do online language exchanges.</li>
  <li>Do a presentation about iOS in English.</li>
  <li>Move to another country.</li>
  <li>Travel around the world as a digital nomad.</li>
  <li>Visit new countries, discover new cultures, and meet new people.</li>
  <li>Attend conferences around the world (I would like to go to WWDC in particular).</li>
  <li>Drink less coffee (I drink three or four times per day).</li>
  <li>Learn how to prepare better coffee.</li>
  <li>Do more cardio.</li>
  <li>Ride my bicycle more.</li>
  <li>Keep going to the gym, three days per week.</li>
  <li>Improve my overall health. I ate healthy food, but there is always room for improvement. I want to eat less bread, maybe replace it with something else at breakfast and dinner. I need to prepare a plan and use it, which is easier said than done.</li>
  <li>Collaborate in open source projects.</li>
  <li>Make my own iOS app and upload it to  the App Store.</li>
  <li>Read more fiction books.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm confident that I can make all this happen by the end of this year, but I;m worried about procrastination.<br>Instant Gratification Monkey is the last creature who should be in charge of your decisions. If you want to know more about what I am talking about, see <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator?utm_source=tedcomshare&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tedspread" target="_blank">this TED talk</a>.</p>

<p>I'm only using Twitter for social media these days and surfing the web, but I always feel spammed with too many distracting/tempting things. I know that some days I will finish my day watching funny cat videos <strong>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</strong>.</p>

<p>PS4, this year I am leaving you &#x1F631;. Nah! I'm joking I'll make some time for movies, reading, playing new releases on PS4, traveling, riding my bike, or sitting on the couch doing nothing. It's always a good idea to make time for yourself even when you're chasing your dreams.
