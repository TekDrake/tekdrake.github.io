<p>I am a passionate developer who is always trying to gain new knowledge to keep pushing my career forward. For around six years, I have been focusing on iOS apps.<br>I have always worked for a software factories and have developed many apps for upload to Apple Store or for use by customers internally in their companies, but because they were for projects in a company that I was working for, I can't put the details on here (due to privacy contracts). I have also developed some libraries and modified some from Github which were included in different projects.</p>  

<p>On 2017 I will be uploading my own stuff. I have some crazy iOS app ideas in mind. I'm also open to collaboration so ping me if you need help &#x1F913;.<br>I have given iOS presentations internally in the company and in a few meetups here in Uruguay. I am interested in being a speaker at meetups or conferences in other countries.</p>

<p>After my trip for Altconf 2016 I returned to Uruguay thinking about relocating to a different country or working remotely like a digital nomad, working and traveling around the world &#x1F680;.</p>

<p>I'm a English learner and I think that the best way to learn is by making many mistakes per day.<br>Always open to exchanges. If you are looking to practice your Spanish or want to know more about my culture please get in touch.<br>This website, <a href="https://www.italki.com/i/AH6fAd" target="_blank">italki</a> has been a very helpful resource for me. I suggest checking it out if you are learning or you want to improve your skills.</p>

<p>I'm a bicycle funboy &#x1F6B4;. I ride my bike every day to my work and I hope to continue to do so for a long time. I am very conscious about my health and staying fit, so I try to go to the gym three times per week and eat healthy food. In my free time, I also enjoy video games (PS4 ftw!)</p>
